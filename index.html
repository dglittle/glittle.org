This was written November 5th, 2015, at 12:36am (so really November 4th, late at night).
This is the first page of the rest of my life.
I plan to post ~1 thing per day, each pointing the way to the next.
The next thing will be the instagram image I'll post after the instagram image taken from this drawing
(which you should be able to click on to make bigger):<br/>
<a href="page1.jpg"><img width="500" src="page1.jpg"></a><br/>
