This was written November 5th, 2015, at 12:36am (so really November 4th, late at night).
This is the first page of the rest of my life.
I plan to post ~1 thing per day, each pointing the way to the next.
The next thing will be the instagram image I'll post after the instagram image taken from this drawing:
<a href="page1.jpg"><img width="500" src="page1.jpg"></a>
<a href="https://instagram.com/dgreglittle/">Note that my instagram account is here.</a>
