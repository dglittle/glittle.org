- fork https://github.com/dglittle/glittle.org
- open "gh-pages" branch

- if there is not a directory called "humanscript", create one
- put these instructions into a new text file in the "humanscript" directory

- open utils/JavaScriptEval
- run it by loading index.html into a web browser
- put a label over the upper left box that says "script"
- put a label over the lower left box that says "input"
- put a label over the right box that says "output"
- move the ">" button next to the "script" label
- rename this button "run >"
- when "run >" is pressed, make the following happen:
    - get a cookie for this page called "history"
    - parse the cookie's value as JSON
    - put result in variable called "h"
    - if the cookie didn't exist, set h to []
    - if h[0] is the same as the text in the script textbox, do nothing
    - if h[0] is different from the text in the script textbox, prepend the current script to h (making it the new h[0], and sliding everything else back)
    - set the "history" cookie to the JSON version of h
- add a button next to "run >" called "history"
- clicking "history" should open a jQuery UI dialog (import jQuery UI from Google's CDN)
- the dialog should get the value of the "history" cookie, and dislay the values, where each value only takes a single line, and is cut off if it is too long
- click a line should close the dialog, and put the script associated with that item into the script textbox

- test
    - load page, should show "print(input)"
    - press "run >"
    - change script to "print(input + 'hi')"
    - press "run >"
    - press "history"
    - take screenshot of dialog (should show "print(input + 'hi')" as first option, and "print(input)" as second option)
    - click second option
    - take screenshot
    - put both of these screenshots in "humanscript/output" directory (you may need to create this directory)

- push this to github
- make a pull request to the original repository
