// part 1

- fork https://github.com/dglittle/glittle.org

- put these instructions, and the subject line of this message, in a new file in the "humanscript" directory (create this directory if it doesn't exist)

// part 2

- run: node _server.js
- load: http://localhost:8080/utils/JavaScriptEval
- when "run >" is clicked, it may attempt to store something in a history cookie
    - if so, before storing the cookie, first check how big it would be (be sure to url encode the data, since the cookie will do this)
    - if it is more than 4k,
    - try removing the oldest item from the history array and try again
    - keep trying until all items have been removed from the history array except for the current item
    - if it looks like it will fit, set the cookie
    - otherwise,
        - don't set the cookie,
        - and add some text next to the history button saying "too big to save"
            - make the text red
- if run is clicked, remove the text saying "too big to save" if it is there
    
- test this
    - run: node _server.js
    - load http://localhost:8080/utils/JavaScriptEval
    - press run button
    - enter "5 // " followed by a very long sequence of a's into the text area (more than 4k of them)
    - press run button
    - should be "5" in the output
    - should see text saying it couldn't put it in the history
    - click history
    - move window out of way of text saying that it couldn't put something in the history
    - take screenshot
    - put screenshot in "humanscript/output"
