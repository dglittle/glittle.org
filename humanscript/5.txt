// part 0

- if you have time to do this task right now, reply-all to this message saying "got it" (only the first person to say "got it" should do it)

- when you log time, use the subject line of this task as the message

// part 1

- fork https://github.com/dglittle/glittle.org

- put these instructions, and the subject line of this message, in a new file in the "humanscript" directory (create this directory if it doesn't exist)

// part 2

- go to glittle.org directory
- make copy of utils/JavaScriptEval
- call it jsEval
- make these changes
    - remove input box
    - make script textbox consume 100% height (like the output)
    - remove the "script" and "output" labels
    - remove the "history" button
    - move the "run >" button between the textareas (where the "<" button is, but at the top instead of the bottom)
    - remove the "<" button
- watch for any changes to the text in the input box,
    if there is a change,
    add a link below the input box that says "get url to this code"
- if the link "get url to this code" is clicked,
    navigate to a new url which is the current url + "#" + url-encoded version of the code in the input box
- when the page loads, check to see if there is a "#" in the url,
    if so,
    then put the stuff after it into the input box (and deal with the url-encoding.. not sure if you'll need to decode it)

- test this
    - run: node _server.js
    - load http://localhost:8080/utils/jsEval
    - enter: print("it works!")
    - click "get url to this code"
    - press run button
    - take screenshot (include address bar)
    - put screenshot in "humanscript/output"

// last part

- commit and push to github
- make pull request to original repository
- respond to this thread saying "done"
